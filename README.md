### single_cell_everything_notes

A chaotic personal collection of things, related to single-cell biology field. Mostly notes on the related talks I've attended, papers I've read and discussions I've stumbled upon. 

# Talk Notes

- Talk on the probabilistic modelling of transcriptional dynamics in whole embryos and single cells by Magnus Rattray, organized by DFKZ and EMBL team. A very interesting take on the temporal regulation of expression and its modelling using _Gaussian processes_. I've also made a brief summary of the talk with link to some of the papers introduced.
