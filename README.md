### single_cell_everything_notes

A chaotic personal collection of things, related to single-cell biology field. Mostly notes on the related talks I've attended, papers I've read and discussions I've stumbled upon. 

# Talk Notes

- Talk on the probabilistic modelling of transcriptional dynamics in whole embryos and single cells by Magnus Rattray, organized by DFKZ and EMBL team. A very interesting take on the temporal regulation of expression and its modelling using _Gaussian processes_ with the highlighted importance of choosing appropriate kernel/covariance function or learning it from the data. Also importance of mapping on the transcript level and dependence of half-life on the transcript-coded function was mentioned (e.g., relation to cell adhesion function primes for a shorter half-life than involvement in signaling receptor binding). One of the most exciting future directions mentioned was deciphering how spatial variation in expression is regulated. I've also made a brief summary of the talk with link to some of the papers introduced. It is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RvMyUsDULHCKc24FRUKVCXsnJd0FnQZB/view?usp=sharing).
